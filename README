Title: SteamScout

Description: The purpose of SteamScout is to give users the capability to track the price

when games meet criteria that they set. In the end, SteamScout saves users money
by providing them with a better chance to purchase the games they want at the 
price they want.

For the application to work in its current state:		
1. Run server.py in the SteamScoutServer project.
2. Run the main application in the SteamScout project.

The server's data primary data is updated in two ways.

One way is via the gameupdater.py python module. This pulls
the steam information for each game in their database and 
writes it to a json file. This is a standalone python module
that is ran when the server is down.

Another way is with the watchlistupdater.py. This module is essential for the
notification functionality. This is the module that is intended to be ran once per day.
It iterates through each game on all watchlists and polls the api for the most up to date
pricing information. This  is ran whenever a game is added to a watchlist as well as once per 
day.
